Overview
-------

* Sample code to get started implementing the [Javascript Plugin](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CA_Commerce/I_Development_Resources/C_Component_Library/E_Product_Selector_JavaScript_Plugin).  This will provide you with the flexibility to add custom pricing logic on change of pricing attributes.  For example, we will specifically look at adding a validation message upon a charge discount exceeding a defined threshold.

* Sample code to add custom logic executed from configured Quoting Rule, by implementing the [Custom Action Plugin](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CA_Commerce/I_Development_Resources/C_Component_Library/C_Global_Classes/D1_RulesEngine_Class/Custom_Action_Plugin).  This can be utilized when you want to access objects or perform complex computations that cannot be accomplished in Rules UI.
